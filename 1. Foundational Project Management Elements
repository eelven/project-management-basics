What Is a Project?
A project is a temporary, one-time, coordinated undertaking
A project...
-has a definable goal
-has interrelated and dependent activities tasks
-is finite in duration
-provides a unique product, service or information
-operates under scope, quality, cost and time constaints

Project[service, information, product]
Ongoing Work Process{Project[service, information, product]}

One of things about a project is the constraints, we have scope, quality, cost and time targets that we're
goint to shoot for.
S, Q, C, T, Targets
-Scope, how big is this project? What does it include?
-Quality, how good does this thing have to be?
-Cost and Time, how big the project is and how good it has to be

You cannot change one constrint without adjusting another one. Work together

Project Management Institute is the governing body for Project Management Worldwide. A new publication
called the Project Management Body of Knowledge, in their latest edition they've said that instead of
scope, quality, cost and time we're going to add two more, risk and resources. triangle -> pentagon

1.4 Stakeholder Analysis (5min)

to determine whose interest should be taken into account throughout the project
definition 2013 PMI: A guide to the (PMBOKGuide) 5ed.

Example: Project stadium

Stakeholder Analysis Matrix
definition 2013 PMI: A guide to the (PMBOKGuide) 5ed. - Based on Chart 10-5

Who are the stakeholders; Why are they on the stakeholder list; What's their power interest
in level and how do we work with them? if we put this list together, we can keep ourselves
as project managers out a lot of trouble. You forget some of your key stakeholders along the
way in the middle of a project, all of the sudden they surprise and you've got some problems
on your hand.

Let's add another Stakeholder
The University President
On a sheet of paper, write down:
1.What do you think the University President's interest is in this project?
2.The president's level of power and interest (Hi or Lo for each)?
3.How you can effectevely work to gain support and reduce obstacles the President might create?
