3.1 Planning and Scheduling (12min)

The Project Schedule
.Show the relationship of the project activities and tasks
.Show the dependencies (which tasks follow other tasks in a logical sequence)

Two Concepts
.Sequential
.Simultaneous
(video 03:12)

Two More concepts
.Critical Path
.Float Time

Critical Path
Generally, but not always, the sequence of schedule activities that determines the
duration of the project. It is the longest path through the project.

Float Time

Total Float Time (Slack Time)
The total amount of time a schedule activity may be delayed from its early start date
without delaying the project finish date or violating a schedule constraint.

Free Float
The total amount of time a schedule activity can be delayed without delaying early
start of any immediately following schedule activities.

What Does a Schedule Look Like?

They both show the same basic information in different ways

The Project Schedule

.Road map
-Project
-Project Manager
-Customers and stakeholders
.Communication tool
.Tracking tool

To track your project you have to know where you should be today
with progress and spending and then you track that against where
you actually are. We have to have a schedule to figure where
we're at with the progress and the project.
