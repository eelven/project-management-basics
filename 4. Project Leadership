4.1 Planning Human Resources (8min)
We've put our project together now.
We've defined what the project is
We've figured out how we're going to do this project
Now we figur out who is going to do this
We have to put all the people on this project.

2 Categories when you're working with human resources issues:

1. Determining the human resource requirements for the
project and then getting them

2. Mamaging and leading the project team during the project

Work and Duration 
2 key factors in determining the human resource needs for
the project are:
.Work (or Effort)
.Duration

One Concept, 3 Terms
Work = Effort = Work Effort
MS Project will talk about work
PMI will talk about effort
Number of texts talk about work effort
All 3 are the exactly same thing. All 3 are the same concept.

Work Effort
The number of labor units required to complete a schedule 
activity or work breakdown structure component, often
expressed in hours, days, or weeks. (PMI 5ed)

Duration
The total number of work periods (not including holidays or
other nonworking periods) required to complete a schedule
activity or work breakdown structure component. Usually
expressed as work days or work weeks. Sometimes incorrectly
equated with elapse time. (PMI 5ed)

(video 02:13) Work and Duration Options
Option 1: Work can be equal to duration
Option 2: We can habe duration be more than work
Option 3: We can have work be more than duration.
It means that Ted has a task to do.
Duration is the time that we have set aside to actually
accomplish work.
(video 05:40) This is how you start to figure out the
duration on your project tasks. If you want a task to
go faster, usually we can put some more people on there
and it will go faster. It might not always go as fast
as we want. Sometimes putting more people on there slow
things down a little bit because people just get in each
others way a little. but, putting more people on a task,
typically will get it done faster.
(video 06:05) When we're looking at the duration of our
projects, first we need to do is figure out how much work
has to be done on a specific task and then we figure out
well how many people are we are going to put on that to get
a certain duration

The other thing is elapsed time:
(video 06:17) With Elapsed Time Added In
Elapsed time is that calendar and the clock
So that's real life time out there.
Instead of a week being 7 days? oh no, it's 5 days
Instead of a day being 24 hours? no, it's 8 hours.
We've converted elapsed time into duration time and said this
is the time we've set aside to do work.
So it can be four ten-hour days or however, you have it set up
in your organization.
What we said, these are the time available to do work.
During that duration, we can get more or less work done on the,
one of these little bars across here you'll see they're pretty tall
That means that on Thursday and Friday, we have some people working
And so we got more than 8 hours worth of work done on the task.
On Wednesday that one week, we got less than 8 hours of work done on
that task.
Weekend, we got nothing done on that task.
When you talk to people about how long it's gonna take to do the
project, you need to find out what people are talking about and
what terms they're using
What do people wanna know whan they say: whe's the project gonna be done?
They're only caring about elapsed time. they just wanna know the date on
the calendar and the time on the clocks. They don't care about work and
duration, the only way that they're gonna see those show up and the way
they're gonna worry about those is cost and time on our SQCT target 
that we looked it. Earlier on, scope, quality, cost and time, Work and
duration will show up in the cost and time piece.

4.2 Assembling the Team

Putting the Full Team Together
.Recruiting/assigning team members
.Working with the functional managers

We also have to work with their functional managers, because a lot
of people have a boss that not you. Typically, as project managers,
we don't have any direct authority over anybody on our project teams.
Although, we have are our leadership skills to get people to do things.
and, we do have to work with their functional managers, because they're
the ones that have to release them to work on our projects.

Team Kick-off Meeting
.Introduce team members
.Clarify the project mission, definition, deliverables
.Answer questions
.Clarify or start developing the project plan

(video 2:20)Adding the Resources
The best way to put resources on your project is by looking at 3 things that
will come into play here
1: Can the person do this task? Will they do this task? Are they available 
during the time frame when we need this task done?

video(4:51) Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM or RACI Chart)

Scheduling Yourself as a Resource
.Changing roles
.Personal time management

You schedule yourself as a resource on a project. You're going to have
changing roles. Sometimes, you're going to be the project manager and
when you're actually doing one of the tasks, you're going to be one of
those people that has the name on the task, and you'll be a task doer.
When doing a task, it might be very comfortable. It's kind of nice quiet
and easy. doing this nice little thing here. Nobody's running the project
it's all on its own. it's on auto pilot It's just roaring down the tracks
all on its own, and you have to hope that the plan is really good, and you
got it laid out well. so, that it can run by itself for a little while, 
you can work on a task. Just don't forget to peek your head up once in
awhile, and see how that project is going. You have 2 different roles, and
a lot of what you'll need to do is manage your time really well to do that.

4.3 Leading and Managing the Team

Why delegating Might be Difficult
.The project manager may not believe the team members can complete the assigned tasks
.The project manager does not want to take the time to train team members
.The project manager is egostical
(mallory, 1991)

Why team members may not want delegation
.There are no rewards
.Are insecure
.Do not have the skills
.Simply don't want to do the task
.Don't trust the project manager or the organization

Evaluating team members' ability to accept delegation:
1.Daily job duties
2.Special skills
3.Unique background or education
4.History of receiving delegated tasks
5.Willingness to accept delegated tasks
6.Willingness to accept training and guidance
7.Previous experience on a project team
8.Overall level of self-confidence
9.Typical level of response to being monitored
10.Personal ambitions and desires

Executing
Initiating->Planning->Executing->Controlling->Closing
Do it !

There May Be a Reason for "Faster" and "Cheaper"
.Meet deadline
.Increase profit margins
.Get to market before a competitor
.Longer project life cycle
.Take advantage of a time-limited-opportunity
.Many others
