4.1 Planning Human Resources (8min)
We've put our project together now.
We've defined what the project is
We've figured out how we're going to do this project
Now we figur out who is going to do this
We have to put all the people on this project.

2 Categories when you're working with human resources issues:

1. Determining the human resource requirements for the
project and then getting them

2. Mamaging and leading the project team during the project

Work and Duration 
2 key factors in determining the human resource needs for
the project are:
.Work (or Effort)
.Duration

One Concept, 3 Terms
Work = Effort = Work Effort
MS Project will talk about work
PMI will talk about effort
Number of texts talk about work effort
All 3 are the exactly same thing. All 3 are the same concept.

Work Effort
The number of labor units required to complete a schedule 
activity or work breakdown structure component, often
expressed in hours, days, or weeks. (PMI 5ed)

Duration
The total number of work periods (not including holidays or
other nonworking periods) required to complete a schedule
activity or work breakdown structure component. Usually
expressed as work days or work weeks. Sometimes incorrectly
equated with elapse time. (PMI 5ed)

(video 02:13) Work and Duration Options
Option 1: Work can be equal to duration
Option 2: We can habe duration be more than work
Option 3: We can have work be more than duration.
It means that Ted has a task to do.
Duration is the time that we have set aside to actually
accomplish work.
(video 05:40) This is how you start to figure out the
duration on your project tasks. If you want a task to
go faster, usually we can put some more people on there
and it will go faster. It might not always go as fast
as we want. Sometimes putting more people on there slow
things down a little bit because people just get in each
others way a little. but, putting more people on a task,
typically will get it done faster.
(video 06:05) When we're looking at the duration of our
projects, first we need to do is figure out how much work
has to be done on a specific task and then we figure out
well how many people are we are going to put on that to get
a certain duration

The other thing is elapsed time:
(video 06:17) With Elapsed Time Added In
Elapsed time is that calendar and the clock
So that's real life time out there.
Instead of a week being 7 days? oh no, it's 5 days
Instead of a day being 24 hours? no, it's 8 hours.
We've converted elapsed time into duration time and said this
is the time we've set aside to do work.
So it can be four ten-hour days or however, you have it set up
in your organization.
What we said, these are the time available to do work.
During that duration, we can get more or less work done on the,
one of these little bars across here you'll see they're pretty tall
That means that on Thursday and Friday, we have some people working
And so we got more than 8 hours worth of work done on the task.
On Wednesday that one week, we got less than 8 hours of work done on
that task.
Weekend, we got nothing done on that task.
When you talk to people about how long it's gonna take to do the
project, you need to find out what people are talking about and
what terms they're using
What do people wanna know whan they say: whe's the project gonna be done?
They're only caring about elapsed time. they just wanna know the date on
the calendar and the time on the clocks. They don't care about work and
duration, the only way that they're gonna see those show up and the way
they're gonna worry about those is cost and time on our SQCT target 
that we looked it. Earlier on, scope, quality, cost and time, Work and
duration will show up in the cost and time piece.
