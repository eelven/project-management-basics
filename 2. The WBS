2. The WBS (30min)

2.1 Planning (11min)

Initiating->Planning->Executing->Controlling->Closing

Planning: Risk
We have to look at risks to figure out what could go wrong
with the project, because sometimes the risks in the project
will actually determine some of the tasks we have to put into
the project.
"To be alive at all involves some risks" - Harold MacMillan

Risks to a Project
.All projects have risks
.It is always best to know upfront
.There are numerous risk analysis tools and methods
.Use at least one

What is "Risk"?
An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive
or negative effect on a project's objectives. (PMBOK 5 ed)

4 Steps :
1- Find the risks
2- Analyze the risks
3- Develop a risk plan
4- Mitigate the risks as they arise

When analyse this risk we're gonna talk about 2 elements
-Impact:
How bad will it be if it happens?
How much will it affect the project?
-Probability:
What are the chances it will occur during the project?
What is the likelihood something will fail?

Now, there's another element to look at: 
-Triggers:
Cain I see it coming before it hits the project?
Will I know when the risk has hit the project and is affecting it?
This trigger piece is a way that helps us figure how we're going to
put a risk management plan into our project.

Make Decisions and Take Actions Based on Risk Priorities
.Determine which risks will affect your project the most
.Decide wich risks are the ones to plan countermeasures for and which to mitigate
.Plan your actions

(08:48) A form that comes from an organization ...
... Every organization needs to figure out how risk adverse they are, and what
that numbers needs to be brought down to so that we say, ok, this is an 
acceptable risk.

|RISK|Impact|Probability|TOTAL|MITIGATION|Impact|Probability|TOTAL|
|    |      |           |     |          |      |           |     |
|    |      |           |     |          |      |           |     |
|____|______|___________|_____|__________|______|___________|_____|
1-Negligible Impact               1-Low Probability
2                                 2
3                                 3   
4                                 4
5-Will Cause Critical Failure     5-Will definitely Occur

We also need then to list our triggers
Now the way that this works, impact and probability are multiplied together
So to get our total numver, it's the number 1 through 5, and their impact
one, number 1 through 5 under probability. We multiply those and come up
with a number.
You'll notice that triggers are not on here. Triggers are going to be a
list that will accompany this chart. and the triggers will be the whole
list of things that tells us when the risk is coming toward the project,
or when the risk has already hit the project and is already affecting it.

Project Tasks
.It all comes down to individual project tasks
The project plan is the lay-out of these tasks with times and resources
assigned.

2.2 Planning and the WBS, Part 1 (5min)
Work Breakdown Structure(WBS)
.A way to plan the tasks for a project
.A way to display the tasks for a project
.A way to communicate the project complexity

What is WBS?
A deliverable-oriented grouping of project elements that organizes and defines
the total scope of the project. Each descending level represents an increasingly
detailed definition of the project work. Work not in the WBS is outside the scope
of the project (PMBOK 2000ed)
Some people say that the work break down structure should include the deliverables
and a high level of work but not all the details of work.
The detailed tasks of the project, according to PMI, would be listed either in a 
thing called a WBS dictionary and or a separate task list, though the tasks would
not be on the WBS. 
Another school of thought, the detailed tasks are on the WBS. Starts with the 
deliverables, goes all the way down though descending layers and levels of detail
until we get to a very fine level of detail called a task, a detailed project task.

Why a WBS ?
.Fundation for planning the project
.Project planning is based on the tasks displayed on the WBS
.Provides a detailed ilustration of the project
.Defines human resource cost etimates
.Provides clear assignmentes to project members

Deliverables and Tasks
We will discuss:
->Project deliverables
->Project tasks
(2:28)
Deliverables_>Work Packages_>Project Activities_>Detailed Tasks
The way the PMI lays out the common terms that are used, we have deliverables at
the high level.
We worked down to work packages, we break the work packages into project activities,
and we break the project activities into detailed tasks.
When we move into a schedule, we are going to put the detailed tasks on the project
schedule.

Two Major Schools at Thought
1. Only include Deiliverables and Work Packages
2. Include Deliverables, Work Packages, Project Activities, Detailed Tasks

The Project Schedule is constructed from the Detailed Tasks.
If you do not list items on the WBS, you still have to list them someplace
possibly in a WBS Dictionary or a Task List.

Identify the Tasks
1. First define the deliverables
2. Then identify the tasks that will create or provide those deliverables

Deliverables have come from the initiating phase, and then in the beginning of
the planning phase, to make sure that we're clear about the deliverables. Now
we're gonna figure out how we're gonna make all this stuff happen.

Deliverable
Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service
that must be produced to complete the process, phase, or project. Often used more
narrowly in reference to an external deliverable, which is a deliverable that is
subject to approval by the project sponsor or customer. (PMBOK 5ed)

Project Activity
A component of work performed during the course of a project (PMBOK 5ed.)

The WBS Will Outline All 3 Ways Scope Is Viewed
.Product Scope: The Things
.Project Scope: The Work
.Scope: The Things and The Work

(video 3:59)
The top level is called Program
Program is a group of related projects, that together these projects make up one
total thing, one total entity of some kind, called a Program.
Most of us are going to be starting at the Project level we're Project Managers
rather than Program Managers who are managing a whole lot of interrelated projects
and Project Managers.

2.3 Planning and the WBS, Part 2 (9min)

WBS Chart Pro (software) (01:30)

There are 2 other ways to put a WBS together:
1:Activity based WBS
One is at the top level instead of deliverables.
At the top level we put act, groups of activities.
A lot of times a project team thinks more in, what's 
the work we have to do ?
2:Phase Based WBS
Sometimes we can put this together as a phase based
WBS too. What's the 1st phase, 2, 3, we have phase, 
we have to do ?

How Detailed?
Stop at the level where work is fine enough detail can
be delegated to a person or group

A rough guideline is 4 - 40 hours
-No shorter that 4 hour tasks
-No longer than 40 hour tasks
-This is only a guideline

Detailed Cost Estimate of the Work Required to Complete
the Project.
The complete WBS is the first opportunity during the Project
Plan that detailed estimates od the total amount work and the
totoal cost of the human resource element of the project can
be developed.
The WBS information will be key in understanding Earned Value
Analysis tools.
We can also use this information a little later on, when we
start to track the project. Track and control the project
