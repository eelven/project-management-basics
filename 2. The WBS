Planning: Risk
We have to look at risks to figure out what could go wrong
with the project, because sometimes the risks in the project
will actually determine some of the tasks we have to put into
the project.
"To be alive at all involves some risks" - Harold MacMillan

Risks to a Project
.All projects have risks
.It is always best to know upfront
.There are numerous risk analysis tools and methods
.Use at least one

What is "Risk"?
An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive
or negative effect on a project's objectives. (PMBOK 5 ed)

4 Steps :
1- Find the risks
2- Analyze the risks
3- Develop a risk plan
4- Mitigate the risks as they arise

When analyse this risk we're gonna talk about 2 elements
-Impact:
How bad will it be if it happens?
How much will it affect the project?
-Probability:
What are the chances it will occur during the project?
What is the likelihood something will fail?

Now, there's another element to look at: 
-Triggers:
Cain I see it coming before it hits the project?
Will I know when the risk has hit the project and is affecting it?
This trigger piece is a way that helps us figure how we're going to
put a risk management plan into our project.

Make Decisions and Take Actions Based on Risk Priorities
.Determine which risks will affect your project the most
.Decide wich risks are the ones to plan countermeasures for and which to mitigate
.Plan your actions

(08:48) A form that comes from an organization ...
... Every organization needs to figure out how risk adverse they are, and what
that numbers needs to be brought down to so that we say, ok, this is an 
acceptable risk.

|RISK|Impact|Probability|TOTAL|MITIGATION|Impact|Probability|TOTAL|
|    |      |           |     |          |      |           |     |
|    |      |           |     |          |      |           |     |
|____|______|___________|_____|__________|______|___________|_____|
1-Negligible Impact               1-Low Probability
2                                 2
3                                 3   
4                                 4
5-Will Cause Critical Failure     5-Will definitely Occur

We also need then to list our triggers
Now the way that this works, impact and probability are multiplied together
So to get our total numver, it's the number 1 through 5, and their impact
one, number 1 through 5 under probability. We multiply those and come up
with a number.
You'll notice that triggers are not on here. Triggers are going to be a
list that will accompany this chart. and the triggers will be the whole
list of things that tells us when the risk is coming toward the project,
or when the risk has already hit the project and is already affecting it.

Project Tasks
.It all comes down to individual project tasks
The project plan is the lay-out of these tasks with times and resources
assigned.
